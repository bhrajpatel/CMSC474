 * This is a place to write GENERAL questions, notes,... If they relate to a SPECIFIC location in the code,
 * please place them next to that location rather than here.
 *
 *
 * NOTES
 * -----
 *
 * - AVOID DETECTION. Do not use any phrases that can be used to find this on the web. Use leetspeak if necessary.
 *   When we are done with the project, one of us will need to download the file to his computer and make the required
 *   changes according to the project description. Then he will submit the file (only one of us has to submit).
 *   Required changes are: update the first line in this file with our correct details, add a description, change
 *   the filename, and remove all comments used to collaborate.
 *
 * - We are working with rectangular 8x14 boards: 8 rows and 14 columns.
 *
 * - To avoid confusion, we will use (i, j) to refer to input/output indexes and (row, col) to refer to the indexes
 *   of our "internal" board implementation. Note that only the COLUMN index has to be modified.
 *
 * - Indexes start from 1 (row/i range is 1-8 and col/j range is 1-14)
 *
 * - I have implemented two helper functions to convert both ways between (i, j) and (row, col).
 *
 * - Cell values are -1: unused cell, 0: empty cell, 1: cell containing our disc, 2: cell containing opponentâ€™s disc.
