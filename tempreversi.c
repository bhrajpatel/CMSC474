/*
 * This is a place to write GENERAL questions, notes,... If they relate to a SPECIFIC location in the code,
 * please place them next to that location rather than here.
 *
 *
 * NOTES
 * -----
 * - We are working with rectangular 8x14 boards: 8 rows and 14 columns.
 *
 * - To avoid confusion, we will use (i, j) to refer to input/output indexes and (row, col) to refer to the indexes
 *   of our "internal" board implementation. Note that only the COLUMN index has to be modified.
 *
 * - The mathematical relationship between the external and internal indexing is [col = j + abs(4 - i)]
 *   and [j = col - abs(4 - row)] (the inverse function).
 *
 * - I have implemented two helper functions to convert both ways between (i, j) and (row, col).
 *
 * - Cell values are -1: unused cell, 0: empty cell, 1: cell containing our disc, 2: cell containing opponentâ€™s disc.
 *
 *
 * QUESTIONS
 * ---------
 * - Do cell indexes (i, j) start from 0 or 1? For now, I am going to assume 1.
 *
